@ec2-instance
Feature: Scripted creation of EC2 Instance
    As a continuous delivery engineer
    I would like my instance to be installed and configured correctly
    so that that my infrastructure server will work as expected

  Background:                               # ./features/instance.feature:7
    Given I can access the AWS environment  # features/step_definitions/instance.rb:4
    And I know what EC2 instance to look at # features/step_definitions/instance.rb:9

  Scenario: The EC2 instance is configured correctly          # ./features/instance.feature:11
    When I lookup the instance information                    # features/step_definitions/instance.rb:17
    Then I should see it is a "t1.micro" instance             # features/step_definitions/instance.rb:21
    And I should see that its security group allows port "22" # features/step_definitions/instance.rb:32
    And I should see that its security group allows port "80" # features/step_definitions/instance.rb:32
    And I should see that it is associated with an elastic IP # features/step_definitions/instance.rb:26

Feature: Scripted creation of webpage with apache httpd on EC2 Instance
    As a continuous delivery engineer
    I would like to provision environment and configure correctly

  Background:                    # ./features/webpage.feature:6
    Given I know the webpage url # features/step_definitions/webpage.rb:4

  Scenario: Webpage is active with correct content                       # ./features/webpage.feature:9
    When I browse the webpage                                            # features/step_definitions/webpage.rb:9
    Then I should see it is active                                       # features/step_definitions/webpage.rb:16
    And I should see that its has "Automation for the people" as content # features/step_definitions/webpage.rb:21
